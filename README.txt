# pyPasswordGenerator

This is a simple Python program named "pyPasswordGenerator" that helps users generate random passwords. Each time the program is run, it asks the users for the desired length of letters, numbers, and symbols in their password, and then creates the password accordingly.

## Getting Started

To use the pyPasswordGenerator script, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the code file is located.

Run the following command to execute the script:

```bash
python pyPasswordGenerator.py

Example:

Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password?
8
How many symbols would you like?
3
How many numbers would you like?
4
Your Password could be: gR9$&6$&eWfD

Based on the user's inputs, the program generates a random password consisting of letters, symbols, and numbers.

Note:

The program uses the random module to select characters randomly.
The string module is imported but not used in the code.
The program will continue to run indefinitely, allowing users to generate passwords multiple times.
